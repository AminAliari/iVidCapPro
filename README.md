# iVidCapPro
iVidCap Pro with arm64, arm7 and bitcode support

This Unity iOS Plugin was Developed by [Eccentric Orbits][1].
I forked the plugin to make it compatible with bitcode and standard architects such as arm64 and arm7.
These capabilities are really needed nowadays and the developer doesn't update his plugin, so here you go!

##Installation##

Just use [the orginal plugin][2] and replace libiVidCapPro.a with the new one.

Happy Coding!
